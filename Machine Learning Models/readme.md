# Classification System Implementation

Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms:
- The core of this project revolves around the implementation and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms to predict the survival of patients with heart failure.

Dataset Exploration and Preprocessing:
- The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains crucial patient information such as age, medical history, and vital signs. Initial exploration involved loading the dataset into a pandas dataframe, followed by visualizations to understand the data's distribution and correlation with the target variable, DEATH_EVENT.

Machine Learning Models:
- To tackle the classification task, a range of supervised machine learning algorithms were employed, including:

- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors

- Each algorithm was fitted to the training dataset and evaluated based on its predictive performance. Notably, the choice of classifiers reflects a diverse ensemble aimed at capturing varying complexities and nuances within the dataset.

Model Evaluation:
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated for each model using techniques like 10-fold cross-validation and stratified k-fold. These metrics provided insights into the models' effectiveness in predicting patient survival outcomes.

Model Selection:
- After rigorous evaluation, Naive Bayes emerged as the top-performing classifier, boasting an accuracy of 76%. Consequently, it was selected as the primary model for predicting patient survival.

Conclusion:
- The implementation of machine learning algorithms in this project underscores their potential in healthcare applications. By leveraging patient data, these models can aid medical professionals in making informed decisions and potentially improving patient outcomes.
